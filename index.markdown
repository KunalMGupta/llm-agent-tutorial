# ðŸ¤– Welcome to the LLM Agent Tutorial

This tutorial is your step-by-step guide to understanding and building a **Large Language Model (LLM) Agent** from scratch.

We'll dive into the core ideas behind LLM agents â€” what they are, why they matter, and how to bring one to life using modern tools and techniques.

Throughout this guide, Iâ€™ve drawn from popular blog posts, academic papers, and open-source codebases to create a **comprehensive, approachable resource**. Whether you're part of the CSE252D class at UCSD or exploring this on your own â€” I hope you find it useful and engaging!

- How to augment LLMs with **tools**, **memory**, and **reasoning**
